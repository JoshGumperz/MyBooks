MyBooks

MyBooks is a book database website. Complete with account creation, book search, and the ability to save a list of all your favorite books!

### Prerequisites

In order to use MyBooks, you'll need a device with internet connection, and a browser.

## Getting Started

I've included screenshots of what the site looks like. The site is also linked below so feel free to take a look. 
Main features include:
- A search function that allows you to input a book title information on that book, including the author, the release date, cover photo, and description
- A save feature which gives the user the ability to save a list of all their favorite books.
- And account creation

Upon initially loading in to the site you will see a page that looks like this:

Alternatively, if you failed to login or sign up correctly the pop up message will look like this:

After searching a book title you will be presented with a search results page containing all of the related search results.

From here, you can once again click on the book to see more information, or you can click on the remove button to remove it from your favorites list.

If you scale the screen down to a smaller size, you'll see the content adjusts to accomodate the new dimensions:
