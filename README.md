MyBooks

MyBooks is a book database website. Complete with account creation, book search, and the ability to save a list of all your favorite books!

### Prerequisites

In order to use MyBooks, you'll need a device with internet connection, and a browser.

## Getting Started

I've included screenshots of what the site looks like. The site is also linked below so feel free to take a look.
Main features include:
- A search function that allows you to input a book title information on that book, including the author, the release date, cover photo, and description
- A save feature which gives the user the ability to save a list of all their favorite books.
- And account creation

Upon initially loading in to the site you will see a page that looks like this:

If you choose, you can hit the login/signup button to either login to an existing account or create a new account. In which case you will be presented with a page that looks like this:

After loggin in or signing up successfully, you will be presented with a popup message that looks like this:

Alternatively, if you failed to login or sign up correctly the pop up message will look like this:

After searching a book title you will be presented with a search results page containing all of the related search results.
